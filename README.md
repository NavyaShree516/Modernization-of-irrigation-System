# Modernization-of-irrigation-System 
Todayâ€™s world population of 7.8 billion is expected to reach about 9.5 billion by 2030, an increase of 35%.Simultaneously, the water demand from non-agricultural sectors will keep growing in both developed and developing countries.The major expected contribution will come from the increase of crop yield.If, due to increasing environmental concern, water withdrawal is reduced with respect to the baseline scenario and higher basin efficiency is attained, then an additional 10 % increase in water productivity is expected.Here, we will be discussing about how the modernization and optimization of irrigation systems can contribute to the increase of water productivity in a context of global water scarcity.
Attention will be paid to the role of irrigated agriculture in the satisfaction of the growing food demand.
